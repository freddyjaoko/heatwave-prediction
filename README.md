Predicting the occurence of heatwaves in Kenya using machine learning

# Summary

In this project I used weather data from the metoerstat Api to forecast the maximum temperature over time. I used an artificial neural network with as it had proven to be the best approach by many researchers.More details about the architecture and hyperparameters can be found in the notebook. 

# Scores

The following are the average metrics achieved:  Mean Squared Error (MSE): 0.1513, Percentage Mean Squared Error (PMSE): 14.67%

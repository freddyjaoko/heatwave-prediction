Predicting the occurence of heatwaves in Kenya using machine learning

# Summary

In this project I used weather data from the metoerstat Api to forecast the maximum temperature over time. The model I used is an artificial neural network(LSTM) with as it had proven to be the best approach by many researchers.More details about the architecture and hyperparameters can be found in the notebook. 

# Scores

The following are the average metrics achieved:  Mean Squared Error (MSE): 0.1513, Percentage Mean Squared Error (PMSE): 14.67%
